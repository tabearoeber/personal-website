I am Tabea, a graduate stats student interested in the intersection of psychology, design, and statistics.

## Something personal

I am a German girl currently living in the Netherlands. I've moved here almost five years ago to begin my undergraduate studies in psychology. Now, four/five years later, I am still enjoying life in NL and am already close to finishing my graduate studies (in statistics; not psychology anymore).

**I love reading**, although I get to do it way too little. I enjoy reading **classics**, like Jane Austen's *Pride of Prejudice* or H. G. Well's *The Time Machine*. I also enjoy and am inspired by **non-fictional**, true-story-based books, like *Educated* by Tara Westerhofer. Lastly, I enjoy reading other non-fictional books from time to time, such as *The Power of Mathematical Thinking* by Jordan Ellenberg or *The Uninhabitable Earth* by David Wallace-Wells .

I have created the tab [BOOKS]({{<ref "books.md" >}}) on this website to keep track of which books I have read, which I enjoyed, and which I still want to read. Feel free to take a look and get inspired :)

As of recently, I also play **tennis and golf**. Like a lot of people in the current times, I felt the desire to get outside and get some fresh air. While I also go on hikes from time to time, feeling the energy of intensitve physical activity is very uplifting.

The last thing I'd like mention here is that I am a quite musical person. I have had **accordeon and guitar** lessons each for 10 years when I was in school. My accordeon didn't move with me to the Netherlands, but my guitar did so I am playing the guitar almost every day. I also sing in the **university choir**.


## Something professional

Undergraduate studies in psychology, graduate studies in statistics. I am super interested in the intersection of psychology, design, and statistics. Here, I find the insights that data can bring to the social aspect (psychology and design) extremely interesting. How can we use data to back up our decisions? How can we communicate data and their meanings in an easy and transparent way to the general public? How can we use insights from statistics to improve the design of consumer products?
