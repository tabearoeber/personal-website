On this page I am keeping track of which books I've read and which I plan to read. This list covers everything I've read since about 2018. I am updating this list from to time, and I hope it will be some inspiration for others. For those books underlined I've written some extra lines on what I liked or disliked. I've also created this general [**OVERVIEW**]( {{< ref "books1/Books_Overview.md" >}}) to keep track of which books I liked and which I would recommend.
