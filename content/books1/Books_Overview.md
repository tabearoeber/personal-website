| Book | Author | Recommend? | &#128077;&#127995; &#127752; | &#128543; &#128163; |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [Educated]( {{< ref "books1/Educated.md" >}}) | Tara Westerhofer | Yes! &#128175; | very interesting writing style | difficult to get into the flow of reading at the beginning |
| [The Uninhabitable Earth]( {{< ref "books1/UninhabitableEarth.md" >}}) | David Wallace-Wells | Yes!! &#128175; | incredibly eye-opening; very good visual description | very heavy, which is necessary though |
| Slumdog Millionaire | Vikas Swarup | Yes |  |  |
| Ein gutes Herz | Leon de Winter | Yes! &#128175; | very interesting novel, nicely written |  |
| The numbers behind Numbers | Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden | Yeah | interesting to take a look at | for my taste, too simple mathematical explanations and examples |
| The cuckoo's calling | Robert Galbraith | Yes! | entertaining crime novel for having a relaxing read |  |
| 1984 | George Orwell | Not really |  | I consider this a must-read book, however it didn't convince me. The story was too shallow. |
| The tattooist of Auschwitz | Heather Morris | Yes! | everyone should know about this cruel history. the writing style was very good |  |
| The president is missing | Bill Clinton and James Patterson | Yeah | different from what I expected but certainly a nice book |  |
| The great Gatsby | F. Scott Fitzgerald | Hmm..&#129300; | not really my taste, but certainly a classic that should be read |  |
| Ich war Hitlerjunge Salomon | Sally Perel | Yes! | I met the author in person, and I think his story is incredible. I remember the book to be very good. |  |
| The time machine | H.G. Wells | Hmm..&#129300; | interesting imagination of the future | again, I think H.G Wells' books should get attention, but the writing style is obviously very difficult which makes it really hard to readPride and Prejudice |
| Pride and Prejudice | Jane Austen | Yes | very nice book to just relax without thinking too much | maybe a bit cliché, but well...sometimes something like this is exactly right |
