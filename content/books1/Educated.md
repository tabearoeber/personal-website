#### What is this book about?

About a girl who grew up isolated from civilisation without going to school or seeing a doctor in her early life, that was eager to learn more about the world, and ended up a PhD from Harvard.

#### What did I Like

Very interestingly written book. The writing style is quite unique, or at least it was different to what I was used to from other books. After overcoming the first few pages, the book was very much drawing me to read on. The book has some energy, that I cannot really describe but that made it a very special book, standing out of the 'crowd'.

#### What did I not Like

The first 50 pages or so were very difficult to read. Tara Westerhofer has a very special way of writing, for which it really needed some time to get used to. The line of the book was not very clear yet. The stories seemed disconnected, and the bigger picture was not very clear to me personally.

#### Recommend or not?

Yes, definitely.
