#### What is this book about?

Climate change and its consequences for us and our world.


#### What did I Like

This book is probably one of the most scariest books I've ever read. The author really describe the extent of climate change and its consequences very visually, which makes it easier to grasp the vast impact climate change has.


#### What did I not Like

Overall, the book is quite pessimistic. But well, that's reality...


#### Recommend or not?

100%. This book should be read in school.
