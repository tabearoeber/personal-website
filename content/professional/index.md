## Skills

My strength definitely lies at the intersection of the human component with the statistical component. I am good at making statistical concepts accessible to someone without experience in the field. I know how to represent data and statistical insight in such a way that everyone can understand, use and built upon them.

I am fluent in R, and have some experience in Python (which is growing every day). I am currently acquiring more knowledge and skills in handling semi-structured data (SQL, XML, JSON, RDF, etc.)

## Current Projects

I am currently working on my **master thesis**, with the topic *Automatic Personality Prediction Using Facial Features.* The idea behind this project is to combine methods of computer vision and deep learning to develop a new approach to personality prediction. Since the project is very much ongoing, I cannot share any more information just yet.

## Work

I am working at the department [Research Methodology, Measurement and Data Analysis at the University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/omd/) as **teaching assistant**. In this role, I am giving tutorials in research methodology and statistics for various bachelor and pre-master studies within the [Faculty of Behavioral, Management and Social Sciences](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/). I enjoy sharing my excitement about the topic with others and therefore really appreciate being a tutor for so many students. While this is my main responsibility as teaching assistant, I also do some grading of exams and assignments, I evaluate and re-write assignments, and help the department out where I can, for example by proof-reading books to be published.

I am also working as a research assistant in the research group [Change Management and Organisational Behaviour at the University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/cmob/). Here, I am managing the data base that holds data of several studies conducted by the research group. Together with a colleague, I have written an R-package to ease communication with the data base and to provide easy access to the data for colleagues without any programming experience.
